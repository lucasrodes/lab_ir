# lab_ir

## Prepare Workspace
To run this program run the following steps:

Create the following directory
```
mkdir postings
```

Download [davisWiki corpus](http://www.csc.kth.se/~jboye/teaching/ir/davisWiki.zip) and [pdfbox library](http://www.csc.kth.se/~jboye/teaching/ir/pdfbox.zip)

## Execute program

Compile the java project as
```
sh compile_all
```

Run the search engine program

```
sh run_search_engine
```

Now you can search for a word. Note that when exiting, you can store the index so that the program does not need to index all the documents again (this is done by clicking on "File/Save and Quit"). If you want the program to re-index, then exit by clicking on "File/Quit".
